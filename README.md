## Upload all files in a local directory to a new Git repository

 If you've created an empty repository in GitHub, you can use these commands to upload your files to Git.

```bash
cd <directory>
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/you/repo
git add .
git commit -m "Message"
git push origin master
```

## Download files from Git repository to a local directory

The opposite of the above option - for example, if your repository exists in GitHub, and you're working on it in a different local computer. Run this command outside of where you want the new directory to appear.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/repo
```

## Remove One File from Git Cache

Remove one cached file.

```bash
git rm -r —-cached <filename.file>
```

## Override Local Directory

If you have some merge conflicts, or accidentally started to make a change to your local directory before pulling the changes from the master, follow these steps.

```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

## Ignore a Directory

If you've been tracking a directory and later decide to ignore the whole directory, simply adding it to .gitignore isn't enough. First you must add the directory to .gitignore, then run this command:

```bash
git rm -r --cached <directory>
```

Then push the changes.

## Add .gitignore to Existing Repository

Similar to above, but if you've added a .gitignore with a lot of changes.

```bash
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Message"
```

## Create a Project Page with GitHub Pages

If you have **repo** set up, but you want `http://you.github.io/repo` to be a page about your project, here's the easiest way I've found to do it.

Commit and push all local changes to your existing repo.

Create your project page in a directory, like **project** or **dist**, that includes an `index.html`. I'll use **dist** for an example.

```bash
git add dist
git commit -am "Create GitHub Page"
git subtree push -prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

Now `http://you.github.io/repo` will be the website you've created for your project. 

If the gh-pages branch already existed, because you tried to do it the way the documentation shows (through the front end) and realized there was no way to add folders (that I know of), you can run this command.

```bash
git push origin `git subtree split —prefix dist master`:gh-pages --force
```

## Force a Push or Pull

When you really want your local repository to override the remote.

```bash
git push -f origin master
git pull -f origin master
```

## Override Local Changes

```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

## Merging Changes from Remote Pull Request with Conflicts

Make a new branch with their changes.

```bash
git checkout -b <their-branch> master
git pull <their.git> master
```

Play with the files and commit them.    

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m “Message"
git push origin master
```

Merge back into your branch.  

```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff <their-branch) (:wq!)
git push origin master
```

## Remove Branch

Put a `:` in front to remove instead of update.

```bash
git push origin :master
```

## Replace Master with Contents of Another Branch

```bash
git checkout <branch>
git merge -s ours master
git checkout master
git merge <branch>
```

## Remove All Local Branches Except Master

```bash
git branch | grep -v "master" | xargs git branch -D
```

More than one branch may be added to the grep. To remove all local branches except "master" and "develop":

```bash
git branch | grep -v "master\|develop" | xargs git branch -D
```

 ## Allow Empty Commit 
 
 Fix the problem of git hooks claiming everything is "Up-to-date".
 
 ```bash
 git push production master
 git commit --allow-empty -m 'push to execute post-receive'
 git push production master
 ```
 
 ## Merge new-feature branch into master
 
 Merge branches

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge new-feature
git push origin master
```
